### Dynamic Programming.

A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. It only works on problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.

* **Overlapping SubProblems:** A problem is said to have overlapping problems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times. E.g Fibonacci Sequence, Every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

* **Optimal substructure:** A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
