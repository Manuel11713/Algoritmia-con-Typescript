/* If we can't count time, then what?
Rather than counting seconds, wich are so variable

Let's count the number of simple operations the computer has to perform*/

// const addUpTo = (n:number) => {
//     var result:number = 0; // here we have 1 assignment
//     for(let i = 1; i<=n ; i++){//here we have 1 assignment, n comparations, n assignments and  n additions
//         result += i // here we have n assignments and n additions
//     }
//     return result;
// } // total operations: 5n+2
